This VIPER Science package is software to support the activities of the 
Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) Science Team.

At the moment, this repo is under significant development and change as we
attempt to craft various pieces of code.  It is very messy and work-in-product.

The VIPER Science Team is developing this software "in the open" in order to 
adhere to the new `NASA Science Information Policy for the Science Mission
Directorate (SPD-41) <https://science.nasa.gov/science-red/s3fs-public/atoms/files/Scientific%20Information%20policy%20SPD-41.pdf>`_ as much as is possible.
